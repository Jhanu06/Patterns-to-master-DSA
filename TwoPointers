### 📘 2. Two Pointers

#### 🧠 Concept

Two Pointers is a technique where two indices move through a data structure (usually an array or string) to solve problems efficiently.  
It is especially effective for **searching, comparing, or traversing** from both ends or in a sliding manner.

---

#### 📌 When to Use

* When the array or list is **sorted**
* To find **pairs or triplets** that satisfy a condition (e.g., sum to target)
* For **removing duplicates**, **partitioning**, or **reversing** data structures
* To replace **brute-force nested loops** with linear-time solutions

---

#### ⚙️ How to Use

1. Initialize two pointers:
   * One at the beginning of the array
   * One at the end (or at a variable distance)

2. Based on the problem's condition:
   * Move the left pointer to the right
   * Or move the right pointer to the left
   * Or move both based on logic

3. Stop when the pointers meet or the condition is satisfied

#### 💻 Example Problem

**Problem:**  
Given a sorted array `nums` and a target value, find two numbers such that they add up to the target.

**Input:**  
`nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, `target = 6`

**Output:**  
`[1, 3]` → because `2 + 4 = 6`

**Explanation:**  
Start with two pointers at both ends, compare their sum with the target, and move accordingly until you find the pair.
